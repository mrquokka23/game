# game
This is a self playing game.
It trains the cars to go around the track using NEAT (neuroevolution of augmenting topologies).
To change the characteristics of the neural network and evolution you can change the config file.
Best genome of a training session is saved in nets folder and can be replayed using the main menu.
The cars movement is tied to the loops of the game, meaning every loop one movement is made. 
This was done to some day maybe convert the movements to real-life measurements and to have the neural net run on a physical vehicle. (I am not sure if it will work)
